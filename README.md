# tatatarot
Tatatarot is a tarot card website where you can read the meaning of cards and you can pick one to see what the chosen tarot card says to you.
It was created in React.js.

How to start?

It's enough to open in Visual Studio Code, if you have it. In the terminal go into the client folder
cd client

type: npm install
If there are any trouble, because it is an old version, you should follow the instructions for "npm audit fix" or "npm audit fix --force".

After that just type (still in the client directory) npm start. It should run fine. Enjoy :)
