It was created in React.js.

How to start?

It's enough to open in Visual Studio Code, if you have it. In the terminal go into the client folder<br>
If you follow this approach, you should delete the package-lock.json since the npm install will regenerate it but can mess up the versions and because of that the application, so be careful!<br>
type: cd client<br>
<br>
type: npm install<br>
If there are any trouble, because it is an old version, you should follow the instructions for "npm audit fix" or "npm audit fix --force".<br>
<br>
After that just type (still in the client directory) npm start. It should run fine. Enjoy :)
