        <h1>What is Tarot?</h1>
        <p>
          The Tarot is a deck of 78 cards, each with its own imagery, symbolism
          and story. The 22 Major Arcana cards represent life's karmic and
          spiritual lessons, and the 56 Minor Arcana cards reflect the trials
          and tribulations that we experience on a daily basis. Some may say
          that Tarot cards are simply ink on paper. However, what I have think
          about it is this:
        </p>
        <p>
          Tarot is the storybook of our life, the mirror to our soul, and the
          key to our inner wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every spiritual lesson we meet in our lives can be found in the
          seventy-eight Tarot cards. And when we consult the Tarot, we’ll get
          shown the exact lessons we need to learn and master to live an
          inspired life. It’s like holding up a mirror to yourself so that you
          can access your subconscious mind and tap into the wisdom (and
          answers) that lives in us all. Tarot is perfect for self-development,
          making choices, manifesting goals, coaching others, planning a
          business, meditating—you name it. Simply ask a question, pull a card,
          and dive into the imagery of the card to give you instant access to
          your inner wisdom and the answer you need.
        </p>
        <h1>How does Tarot work?</h1>
        <p>
          While many people believe that Tarot will tell you the future, making
          predictions are not really what Tarot cards are about.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to Tarot, fortune-telling is out, and intuition is in,
          especially if you want to create your ideal future and manifest your
          goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most powerful way to read the Tarot is to use the cards to access
          your intuition and your inner wisdom. The imagery in the cards give
          you instant access to your subconscious mind and your intuition. And
          from this place of inner power and wisdom, you can discover how to
          make positive changes now so you can manifest your goals and your
          dreams in the future.
